# Pattern Recognition Projects

Welcome to my pattern recognition projects repository! This repository contains a collection of projects related to pattern recognition implemented in Python. Whether you're a student, researcher, or enthusiast interested in pattern recognition, you'll find various projects and resources here to explore and learn from.

## Introduction

Pattern recognition is a fascinating field that involves the identification and interpretation of patterns within data. In this repository, I share my Python implementations of various pattern recognition techniques, algorithms, and applications.

## Features

- **Open Source**: All projects and codes are open-source and free to use.
- **Python**: Projects are implemented using Python, a versatile and popular programming language.
- **Datasets**: I provide datasets used in the projects, allowing you to experiment and analyze patterns with real-world data.
- **Educational**: Whether you're a beginner or an experienced practitioner, these projects serve as educational resources to understand and apply pattern recognition concepts.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects included in this repository:

- [Project 1](/Persian-oneDigit-number): Detecting the Persian OneDigit Numbers with KNN Method.

Feel free to explore each project folder to find detailed documentation, code, and datasets.
